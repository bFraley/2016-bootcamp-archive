# HTML-challenge

My complete, but ongoing, solution to this challenge is published 
[HERE](https://bfraley.github.io/HTML-challenge/)

An HTML/CSS page that is intentionally broken. 
The goal is to have students identify and fix the code. 
This is a real-world situation that they may face in the tech industry. 
Be mindful that there are definite code errors and mixed syntax.
Good luck.
